# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## You're all set! 🎉

Your Pokédex GB is ready to run. The development server should already be starting up.

## 📋 What's Included

✅ **Complete Game Boy UI** - Retro shell with D-pad, buttons, and monochrome green screen  
✅ **Pokémon Grid** - Browse all Pokémon with infinite scroll  
✅ **Search & Filters** - Find Pokémon by name or type  
✅ **Detail Modal** - View stats, sprites, abilities, and more  
✅ **Keyboard Controls** - Full keyboard navigation support  
✅ **Mobile Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes  
✅ **Performance Optimized** - Caching, lazy loading, debouncing  

## 🎮 How to Use

### Starting the App

If the dev server isn't already running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Navigation

1. **Browse**: Scroll through the grid to see all Pokémon
2. **Search**: Type in the search box to filter by name
3. **Filter**: Click "TYPE" to filter by Pokémon types (can select multiple!)
4. **View Details**: Click any Pokémon card to see full stats
5. **Close Modal**: Press ESC, B, or click the X button

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Tab` - Navigate between cards
- `Enter` or `A` - Open details for selected card
- `Esc` or `B` - Close modal
- Type in search box - Filter by name

## 🎨 Features to Try

1. **Multi-Type Filter**: Try selecting "fire" and "flying" to find Charizard
2. **Sprite Variants**: In the modal, switch between normal and shiny sprites
3. **Infinite Scroll**: Just keep scrolling - more Pokémon load automatically
4. **Responsive Design**: Resize your browser or try on mobile
5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Try navigating without your mouse!

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port 5173 already in use?**
- Kill the existing process or Vite will automatically use port 5174

**TypeScript errors?**
- Try restarting your editor or the dev server

**Pokémon not loading?**
- Check your internet connection (uses PokéAPI)
- Check browser console for errors

**Styling looks wrong?**
- Make sure Tailwind CSS is compiling (check terminal for errors)

## 📚 Next Steps

Want to extend the app? Check out the TODO list in README.md:

- Add favorites with localStorage
- Compare two Pokémon side-by-side
- Add sound effects
- Display evolution chains
- Add generation filter
- Type effectiveness chart

## 🎯 Code Structure

```
src/
├── components/       # All React components
├── api.ts           # PokéAPI integration
├── store.ts         # Zustand state management
├── types.ts         # TypeScript definitions
└── index.css        # Global styles

Key Components:
- GameBoyFrame: The retro shell
- Screen: Monochrome display
- PokedexGrid: Main grid with infinite scroll
- PokemonModal: Detail view
- Toolbar: Search & filters
```

## 💡 Tips

- The app caches Pokémon details, so opening the same Pokémon twice is instant!
- Images are lazy-loaded for better performance
- Search is debounced by 250ms to avoid excessive filtering
- Type filters work together (AND logic) - select multiple to narrow down

**Enjoy your retro Pokémon journey! 🎮✨**
